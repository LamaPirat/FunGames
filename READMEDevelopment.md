## Git Workflow

### Pulling Changes

Before starting work on your local copy, make sure your local branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Pushing Changes

When you're ready to push your changes to the remote repository, follow these steps:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit your changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Add meaningful commit message"

# Push your changes to the remote repository
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

### Creating a Branch

Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix to isolate changes and keep the main branch clean:

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Make changes, commit, and push as usual
```

### Merging a Branch into Main

When your feature or bug fix is complete and has been reviewed, follow these steps to merge it into the main branch:

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the latest changes from the main branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. Switch back to your feature branch and rebase it on the latest main:

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/my-new-feature
   git rebase main
   ```

3. Resolve any conflicts if necessary.

4. Push your updated branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-new-feature
   ```

5. Create a pull request (PR) on GitHub to merge your branch into main. Request code review from team members.

6. Once the PR is approved and any requested changes are made, merge it into the main branch.

## Code Review

### Best Practices

1. **Small, Focused PRs**: Keep your PRs small and focused on a single feature or bug fix. This makes code review easier and faster.

2. **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Use clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of each change.

3. **Code Style**: Follow our project's coding style guidelines. Consistency matters.

4. **Testing**: Ensure your code is well-tested, and include test cases with your PR.

5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation for any changes you make.

6. **Peer Review**: Collaborate and review code with team members. Address all comments and feedback before merging.

7. **No Direct Pushes**: Avoid pushing directly to the main branch. Always create branches and use PRs for code changes.

## Getting Help

If you have questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to your fellow team members or project leads. Collaboration and communication are key to a successful development process.

Happy coding!
