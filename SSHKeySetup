Certainly, if you want to remove step 5 (creating an SSH passphrase) and step 6 (adding the SSH key to the SSH agent), you can simplify the process. Here's the updated tutorial:

**Step 1: Create a GitHub Account**

If you haven't already, go to [GitHub's website](https://github.com) and sign up for a new account by providing your email address, a username, and a strong password. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process.

**Step 2: Install Git**

If Git is not already installed on your computer, you'll need to install it. You can download and install Git from the official Git website: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**Step 3: Generate SSH Key Pair**

Now, you need to generate an SSH key pair. This key pair will consist of a private key (which you keep secret) and a public key (which you'll add to your GitHub account). Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command, replacing `<your_email@example.com>` with your email address:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your_email@example.com>"
```

You can also use `-t rsa` if you prefer RSA keys. Press Enter to run the command.

**Step 4: Choose a Secure Location for Your SSH Key**

You'll be prompted to choose a location to save the SSH key. The default location is usually fine. Press Enter to accept the default location or specify a custom one if you prefer.

**Step 5: Copy Your SSH Public Key**

Now, you need to copy the content of your SSH public key. Use the following command to display it:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub  # Replace with the path to your public key if different
```

Highlight and copy the entire key, including the `ssh-ed25519` prefix and your email address.

**Step 6: Add Your SSH Key to GitHub**

Log in to your GitHub account, and then click on your profile picture in the top-right corner. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

In the left sidebar, click on "SSH and GPG keys."

Click the "New SSH key" button.

Give your key a descriptive title, like "My SSH Key."

In the "Key" field, paste the SSH key you copied in Step 5.

Click the "Add SSH key" button.

**Step 7: Confirm SSH Key Setup**

To confirm that your SSH key is set up correctly, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You may see a security warning. Type "yes" to continue.

If everything is set up correctly, you should receive a message like:

```
Hi <your_username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Congratulations! Your GitHub account is now ready with an SSH key for secure and convenient access. You can now clone, push, and pull repositories without needing to enter your username and password each time.
